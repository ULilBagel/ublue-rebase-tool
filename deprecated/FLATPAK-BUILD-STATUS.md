   - Enhanced metainfo.xml with full application details
   - Ready for Flathub submission

## ðŸš§ Build Environment Issue

The current system doesn't have `flatpak-builder` installed, which is required to create the actual Flatpak bundle. However, all files are properly prepared and validated.

## ðŸ“¦ Distribution Package

A tarball has been created with all necessary files:
- `ublue-rebase-tool-flatpak-files.tar.gz`

This contains the complete file structure that would be installed by Flatpak.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### On a System with Flatpak Builder:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install flatpak flatpak-builder
   flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
   flatpak install -y flathub org.gnome.Platform//46 org.gnome.Sdk//46
   ```

2. **Build the Flatpak**:
   ```bash
   ./build-flatpak.sh
   ```

3. **Test Locally**:
   ```bash
   flatpak install --user ublue-rebase-tool.flatpak
   flatpak run io.github.ublue.RebaseTool
   ```

### For Flathub Submission:

1. **Push to GitHub** and create a release tag
2. **Update manifest** with git source and commit hash
3. **Fork Flathub repository**
4. **Submit pull request** with the manifest
