# Requirements - Fix Import Errors

## Overview
Fix the remaining import errors in the test suite caused by module naming mismatch between the main application file and test imports.

## Codebase Analysis Summary
- **Main application file**: `src/ublue-image-manager.py` (with hyphens)
- **Test imports expecting**: `ublue_image_manager` (with underscores)
- **Affected test files**: 
  - `test_error_handling.py` (3 tests)
  - `test_ui_components.py` (entire file)
  - `test_integration.py` (entire file)
- **Classes to import**: `UBlueImageAPI`, `UBlueImageWindow`, `UBlueImageApplication`
- **All classes are defined in**: `src/ublue-image-manager.py`

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enable Python Module Import
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run all tests without import errors, so that I can verify the complete test suite functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN running the test suite THEN all tests SHALL execute without ModuleNotFoundError
2. WHEN importing ublue_image_manager in tests THEN the module SHALL be found and loaded successfully
3. IF the main file uses hyphens in its name THEN the import system SHALL handle the naming difference

### Requirement 2: Maintain Existing File Structure
**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want to preserve the existing file naming conventions, so that the project structure remains consistent with Universal Blue standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN fixing imports THEN the main application file `ublue-image-manager.py` SHALL retain its hyphenated name
2. IF file renaming is needed THEN it SHALL be done in a way that preserves git history
3. WHEN the fix is applied THEN all existing functionality SHALL continue to work

### Requirement 3: Test Suite Completeness
**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want all 93 tests to run successfully, so that I can ensure full code coverage and quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN running `python tests/run_all_tests.py` THEN all 93 tests SHALL execute
2. IF import errors are fixed THEN the test count SHALL remain at 93 tests
3. WHEN tests complete THEN only actual test failures SHALL be reported, not import errors

### Requirement 4: Python Import Best Practices
**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want the import solution to follow Python best practices, so that the code is maintainable and portable.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN implementing the fix THEN it SHALL use standard Python import mechanisms
2. IF sys.path manipulation is needed THEN it SHALL be done safely and cleanly
3. WHEN the solution is implemented THEN it SHALL work across different Python environments

## Success Criteria
- All 93 tests run without import errors
- No changes to the hyphenated filename `ublue-image-manager.py`
- Tests can import classes using `from ublue_image_manager import ...`
- Solution works with the existing test runner infrastructure

## Technical Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with Python 3.x
- Cannot rename the main application file (Universal Blue convention)
- Must work with the existing test discovery mechanism
- Should not require changes to individual test files if possible

## Out of Scope
- Fixing actual test failures (only import errors)
- Refactoring the application structure
- Changing test framework or runner
- Modifying the application's functionality

Do the requirements look good? If so, we can move on to the design.
